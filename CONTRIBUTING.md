---

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

<!--
  Before contributing, ensure you have the following tools installed on your
  development machine. These are required for building and running the ZYNC
  desktop application from source.
-->

Ensure you have the following tools installed on your development machine:

| Tool | Minimum Version | Installation |
|------|----------------|-------------|
| **Node.js** | 18.x | [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/) |
| **npm** | 9.x | Included with Node.js |
| **Git** | 2.x | [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/) |
| **Python** | 3.x | [python.org](https://python.org/) |
| **VS Code** | Latest | [code.visualstudio.com](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (recommended) |

**Platform-specific requirements:**

- **Windows**: Visual Studio Build Tools 2019+ (for native module compilation)
- **macOS**: Xcode Command Line Tools (`xcode-select --install`)
- **Linux**: `build-essential` package (`sudo apt install build-essential`)

### Fork and Clone

<!--
  The standard GitHub fork-and-clone workflow is used for contributions.
  This ensures that contributors work on their own copy of the repository
  and submit changes through pull requests.
-->

1. **Fork the repository** by clicking the "Fork" button on the
   [ZYNC GitHub page](https://github.com/ChitkulLakshya/Zync)

2. **Clone your fork** to your local machine:
   ```bash
   # Replace YOUR_USERNAME with your GitHub username
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/Zync.git

   # Navigate into the project directory
   cd Zync
   ```

3. **Add the upstream remote** to keep your fork in sync:
   ```bash
   # Add the original repository as the upstream remote
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/ChitkulLakshya/Zync.git

   # Verify the remotes are set up correctly
   git remote -v
   # origin    https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/Zync.git (fetch)
   # origin    https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/Zync.git (push)
   # upstream  https://github.com/ChitkulLakshya/Zync.git (fetch)
   # upstream  https://github.com/ChitkulLakshya/Zync.git (push)
   ```

### Install Dependencies

<!--
  Install all project dependencies using npm. This may take several minutes
  depending on your internet connection. Some native modules may need to be
  compiled during installation.
-->

```bash
# Install all dependencies (production + development)
npm install

# Verify the installation by running a type check
npx tsc --noEmit
```

### Set Up Environment Variables

<!--
  The ZYNC application requires certain environment variables to connect to
  Firebase and the backend API. These are stored in a .env file that is
  NOT committed to version control for security reasons.
-->

```bash
# Copy the example environment file
cp .env.example .env

# Edit the .env file with your Firebase credentials and API URL
# You can get Firebase credentials from the Firebase Console:
# https://console.firebase.google.com/
```

---

## Development Workflow

### Branch Naming Convention

<!--
  Consistent branch naming makes it easy to understand the purpose of a
  branch at a glance. We use a prefix-based naming convention that
  categorizes branches by their intended change type.
-->

Use the following naming convention for branches:

| Prefix | Purpose | Example |
|--------|---------|---------|
| `feature/` | New feature or enhancement | `feature/global-shortcuts` |
| `fix/` | Bug fix | `fix/tray-icon-not-showing` |
| `docs/` | Documentation changes | `docs/update-api-reference` |
| `refactor/` | Code refactoring | `refactor/ipc-handler-cleanup` |
| `test/` | Adding or updating tests | `test/auto-updater-tests` |
| `ci/` | CI/CD changes | `ci/add-linux-build` |
| `chore/` | Maintenance tasks | `chore/update-dependencies` |

**Example workflow:**

```bash
# Create a new feature branch from the latest main
git checkout main
git pull upstream main
git checkout -b feature/my-new-feature
```

### Making Changes

<!--
  When making changes, follow these guidelines to ensure your contributions
  are clean, focused, and easy to review.
-->

1. **Keep changes focused**: Each pull request should address a single concern.
   If you find additional issues while working, create separate branches for them.

2. **Update documentation**: If your changes affect the public API, user-facing
   behavior, or development setup, update the relevant documentation.

3. **Add tests**: New features should include tests. Bug fixes should include a
   test that reproduces the bug to prevent regressions.

4. **Follow existing patterns**: When in doubt, look at how similar functionality
   is implemented elsewhere in the codebase and follow the same patterns.

### Running the Application

<!--
  The ZYNC application can be run in several modes depending on what you're
  working on. The most common is the full Electron development mode.
-->

```bash
# Run the full Electron application in development mode
# This starts both the Vite dev server and the Electron app
npm run electron:dev

# Run only the web application (useful for frontend-only changes)
npm run dev

# Run with verbose Electron logging (useful for debugging main process)
ELECTRON_ENABLE_LOGGING=1 npm run electron:dev
```

### Testing Your Changes

<!--
  Before submitting a pull request, ensure your changes pass all tests
  and don't introduce any linting errors or type errors.
-->

```bash
# Run the TypeScript type checker
npx tsc --noEmit

# Run ESLint to check for code style issues
npm run lint

# Run the test suite
npm test

# Run tests in watch mode (useful during development)
npm run test:watch
```

---

## Coding Standards

### TypeScript Guidelines

<!--
  TypeScript is used throughout the ZYNC project. Following these guidelines
  ensures type safety and code consistency across the codebase.
-->

1. **Prefer explicit types** over `any`:
   ```typescript
   // ✅ Good: Explicit type annotation
   function getUser(id: string): Promise<User | null> {
     return userService.findById(id);
   }

   // ❌ Bad: Using any
   function getUser(id: any): any {
     return userService.findById(id);
   }
   ```

2. **Use interfaces for object shapes**:
   ```typescript
   // ✅ Good: Interface for object shape
   interface WindowConfig {
     width: number;
     height: number;
     title: string;
     resizable?: boolean;
   }

   // ❌ Bad: Inline object type
   function createWindow(config: { width: number; height: number; title: string }) {}
   ```

3. **Use enums or const objects for fixed values**:
   ```typescript
   // ✅ Good: Const object with type assertion
   const IPC_CHANNELS = {
     DOWNLOAD_PLATFORM: 'download-platform',
     OPEN_SETTINGS: 'open-settings',
     CHECK_UPDATES: 'check-for-updates',
   } as const;
   ```

4. **Prefer `readonly` for immutable properties**:
   ```typescript
   interface AppConfig {
     readonly appId: string;
     readonly version: string;
     theme: 'light' | 'dark' | 'system';
   }
   ```

### React Component Guidelines

<!--
  React components in ZYNC follow specific patterns to ensure consistency,
  reusability, and maintainability.
-->

1. **Use functional components** with TypeScript interfaces for props:
   ```typescript
   interface ButtonProps {
     /** The text content of the button */
     label: string;
     /** Click handler function */
     onClick: () => void;
     /** Optional variant for styling */
     variant?: 'primary' | 'secondary' | 'danger';
     /** Whether the button is disabled */
     disabled?: boolean;
   }

   const Button: React.FC<ButtonProps> = ({
     label,
     onClick,
     variant = 'primary',
     disabled = false,
   }) => {
     return (
       <button
         className={`btn btn-${variant}`}
         onClick={onClick}
         disabled={disabled}
       >
         {label}
       </button>
     );
   };
   ```

2. **Use custom hooks** to extract reusable logic:
   ```typescript
   // ✅ Good: Custom hook for window resize
   function useWindowSize() {
     const [size, setSize] = useState({ width: 0, height: 0 });

     useEffect(() => {
       const handleResize = () => {
         setSize({ width: window.innerWidth, height: window.innerHeight });
       };

       window.addEventListener('resize', handleResize);
       handleResize();

       return () => window.removeEventListener('resize', handleResize);
     }, []);

     return size;
   }
   ```

3. **Organize component files** consistently:
   - Imports (React, third-party, local)
   - Interface/type definitions
   - Component definition
   - Sub-components (if any)
   - Export statement

### Electron Main Process Guidelines

<!--
  The Electron main process has special considerations due to its Node.js
  environment and its role in managing the application lifecycle.
-->

1. **Always validate IPC inputs** from the renderer process:
   ```typescript
   ipcMain.handle('save-file', async (_event, filePath: unknown, content: unknown) => {
     // Validate inputs before processing
     if (typeof filePath !== 'string' || typeof content !== 'string') {
       throw new Error('Invalid arguments: expected (string, string)');
     }

     // Sanitize file path to prevent directory traversal
     const safePath = path.resolve(app.getPath('userData'), path.basename(filePath));

     await fs.promises.writeFile(safePath, content, 'utf-8');
   });
   ```

2. **Use proper error handling** with try-catch blocks:
   ```typescript
   try {
     await autoUpdater.checkForUpdates();
   } catch (error) {
     logger.error('Failed to check for updates:', error);
     // Don't crash the app for non-critical failures
   }
   ```

3. **Clean up resources** when windows are closed:
   ```typescript
   mainWindow.on('closed', () => {
     mainWindow = null;  // Allow garbage collection
     // Clean up any event listeners or timers
   });
   ```

### CSS and Styling Guidelines

<!--
  ZYNC uses Tailwind CSS for the renderer process (React app) and vanilla
  CSS for the Electron-specific pages (settings, splash screen).
-->

1. **Use Tailwind CSS** classes for React components
2. **Use vanilla CSS** for Electron-specific pages (settings, splash)
3. **Follow BEM naming** for vanilla CSS: `.block__element--modifier`
4. **Support both light and dark themes** using CSS custom properties
5. **Use relative units** (rem, em) instead of absolute units (px) where possible

### Documentation Guidelines

<!--
  Good documentation is essential for maintaining a large codebase.
  Follow these guidelines when writing comments and documentation.
-->

1. **Document all exported functions and classes** with JSDoc comments
2. **Include @param and @returns** tags for function documentation
3. **Explain "why"** in comments, not just "what"
4. **Update README.md** when adding new features or changing the setup process
5. **Include code examples** in documentation for complex APIs

---

## Commit Message Convention

<!--
  We follow the Conventional Commits specification for all commit messages.
  This enables automated changelog generation and semantic versioning.
  
  Reference: https://www.conventionalcommits.org/
-->

We use the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/)
specification for commit messages. This enables automated changelog generation
and makes it easier to understand the history of changes in the project.

### Format

```
<type>(<scope>): <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer]
```

### Commit Types

| Type | Description | Example |
|------|-------------|---------|
| `feat` | New feature or enhancement | `feat: add system tray icon` |
| `fix` | Bug fix | `fix: resolve window flicker on startup` |
| `docs` | Documentation changes | `docs: update installation guide` |
| `style` | Code style changes (formatting, etc.) | `style: fix indentation in menu.ts` |
| `refactor` | Code refactoring (no feature/fix) | `refactor: extract IPC handlers` |
| `test` | Adding or updating tests | `test: add auto-updater unit tests` |
| `chore` | Maintenance tasks | `chore: update electron to v28` |
| `ci` | CI/CD changes | `ci: add macOS build to workflow` |
| `perf` | Performance improvements | `perf: optimize window creation` |

### Commit Scope

<!--
  The scope provides additional context about what area of the codebase
  the commit affects. Common scopes for the ZYNC project include:
-->

| Scope | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `main` | Electron main process |
| `renderer` | Renderer process (React app) |
| `preload` | Preload scripts |
| `settings` | Settings page |
| `ipc` | IPC communication |
| `tray` | System tray |
| `menu` | Application menu |
| `updater` | Auto-updater |
| `build` | Build configuration |
| `deps` | Dependency updates |

### Commit Examples

```bash
# Feature with scope
feat(tray): add notification count badge to tray icon

# Bug fix with body
fix(main): prevent multiple instances of settings window

Previously, clicking "Settings" multiple times would create duplicate
windows. Now it focuses the existing window if one is already open.

# Breaking change
feat(ipc)!: restructure IPC channel naming

BREAKING CHANGE: All IPC channels have been renamed to use
kebab-case convention. Update any renderer code that references
IPC channels directly.
```

## Project Architecture

### Directory Structure Overview

<!--
  Understanding the project structure is essential for making meaningful
  contributions. The project follows a clear separation between the
  Electron main process and the renderer process.
-->

```
electron/           → Electron main process (Node.js)
├── main/           → Main process modules (menu, tray, window state)
├── preload/        → Preload script type definitions
├── services/       → Background services (auto-updater)
├── settings/       → Settings window (HTML/CSS/JS)
├── utils/          → Utility functions (logger, network, paths)
├── config/         → Configuration (CSP, permissions, constants)
├── interfaces/     → TypeScript interfaces
├── assets/         → Embedded assets (icons, logos)
├── main.ts         → Main process entry point
└── preload.ts      → Preload script entry point

src/                → Renderer process (React + Vite)
├── components/     → React components
├── hooks/          → Custom React hooks
├── lib/            → Library utilities
├── pages/          → Page components
├── services/       → API service modules
├── App.tsx         → Root component
└── main.tsx        → Entry point
```

### Main Process vs Renderer Process

<!--
  Understanding the difference between the main and renderer processes
  is critical for Electron development. Code placed in the wrong process
  can cause security vulnerabilities or runtime errors.
-->

| Aspect | Main Process | Renderer Process |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|
| **Environment** | Node.js | Chromium (browser) |
| **File Location** | `electron/` | `src/` |
| **Access** | Full OS access | Sandboxed (limited) |
| **Window** | No window, runs in background | Runs inside BrowserWindow |
| **Examples** | File I/O, system tray, menus | UI components, user interaction |

### IPC Communication Patterns

<!--
  IPC is the bridge between the main and renderer processes. Following
  consistent patterns ensures security and maintainability.
-->

```
Renderer → Main (one-way):   ipcRenderer.send() → ipcMain.on()
Renderer → Main (two-way):   ipcRenderer.invoke() → ipcMain.handle()
Main → Renderer (one-way):   mainWindow.webContents.send() → ipcRenderer.on()
```
