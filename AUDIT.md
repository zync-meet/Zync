# System Audit Report 🛡️

> **Date**: 2026-01-15
> **Scope**: Full Repository Analysis

## 1. Database Architecture: **Hybrid (Risk: Medium)**

The project uses two database ORMs simultaneously, which increases complexity and potential for data desync.

*   **Primary (Mongoose)**: Handles 90% of the app (Users, Projects, Notes).
*   **Secondary (Prisma)**: Used *strictly* for the `GitHub Sync Engine`.
    *   **Risk**: The `Task` entity exists in both MongoDB (embedded in Project) and Prisma (as a table). The Webhook updates Prisma, but the Frontend reads from Mongoose.
    *   **Mitigation**: Ensure `linkRoutes.js` or `socket.io` events strictly keep these in sync.

## 2. Code Quality & Organization

### Dead Code 💀
*   **`backend/routes/githubRoutes.js`**: This file is **UNUSED**.
    *   *Evidence*: `backend/index.js` imports `routes/github` (which resolves to `github.js`). `githubRoutes.js` is a duplicate/legacy file and should be deleted to avoid confusion.

### Architectural Patterns 🏗️
*   **"Fat Routes" Anti-Pattern**:
    *   Most business logic (Project Generation, Meet Invite, GitHub OAuth) is written directly inside `backend/routes/*.js` files.
    *   **Exception**: `inspirationController.js` is the *only* controller used (by `designRoutes.js`).
    *   **recommendation**: Refactor route logic into dedicated logic/service files to improve testability.

### Dependency Check 📦
*   **Root `package.json`**:
    *   Contains `firebase-admin`. **Warning**: This SDK is for server-side use. Including it in the frontend bundle (even if unused) bloats the size and might trigger build warnings.
*   **Backend `package.json`**:
    *   Using `express@^5.2.1`. This is valid but ensure compatibility with all middleware.

## 3. Security Audit 🔒

| Check | Status | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Headers** | ✅ Pass | `helmet` is configured with strict CSP in `index.js`. |
| **Auth** | ✅ Pass | `verifyToken` (Firebase Admin) middleware protects key routes. |
| **Tokens** | ✅ Pass | OAuth tokens are **AES-256 Encrypted** before storage in MongoDB. |
| **Webhooks** | ✅ Pass | GitHub Webhook validates `HMAC SHA-256` signature. |
| **Secrets** | ⚠️ Note | Ensure `ENCRYPTION_KEY` is high-entropy in production. |

## 4. Frontend Internal Audit

*   **State Management**:
    *   Uses **Hooks-over-Context** approach (`useUserSync`). This is cleaner than massive Context Providers but makes centralized debugging slightly harder.
*   **Performance**:
    *   `react-big-calendar` and `blocknote` are heavy dependencies. Ensure code-splitting is active (Vite handles this well by default).

## 5. Action Plan

1.  **Delete** `backend/routes/githubRoutes.js`.
2.  **Move** `firebase-admin` from Root `dependencies` to Backend `dependencies` (if not already there) or `devDependencies` if used for scripts.
3.  **Refactor** `projectRoutes.js` to extract the Gemini AI logic into `services/aiService.js`.
