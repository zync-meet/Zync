 * @module githubAppAuth
 *
 * ============================================================================
 * ZYNC ENTERPRISE ARCHITECTURE DOCUMENTATION
 * ============================================================================
 *
 * 1. ARCHITECTURAL CONTEXT
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * This module is a critical component of the Zync platform's Server-Side API & Business Logic Layer.
 * It is designed to operate within a highly scalable, distributed micro-services
 * or monolithic-hybrid architecture. The logic contained within this file has 
 * been strictly organized to adhere to SOLID principles, ensuring maintainability,
 * scalability, and ease of testing.
 *
 * 2. SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * - Data Sanitization: All inputs processed by this module must be sanitized
 *   to prevent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and SQL/NoSQL Injection attacks.
 * - Authentication: If this module handles sensitive user data, it assumes
 *   that the calling context has already verified the user's JWT or session token.
 * - Rate Limiting: High-frequency operations triggered by this file should be
 *   subject to API rate limiting to prevent Denial of Service (DoS) attacks.
 * - PII Handling: Personally Identifiable Information (PII) must never be
 *   logged in plaintext by this module.
 *
 * 3. PERFORMANCE & OPTIMIZATION
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * - Time Complexity: Operations within this file are optimized for O(1) or O(n)
 *   where possible. Nested iterations should be strictly reviewed.
 * - Memory Management: Variables and closures should be properly scoped to 
 *   prevent memory leaks, especially in long-running Node.js processes or
 *   React component lifecycles.
 * - Caching: Redundant data fetching or heavy computations should leverage
 *   Redis (backend) or React Query / local state (frontend) caching mechanisms.
 *
 * 4. TESTING GUIDELINES
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * - Unit Tests: Every exported function or component in this file must have 
 *   accompanying unit tests covering at least 90% of the code paths.
 * - Mocking: External dependencies (APIs, databases, third-party libraries)
 *   must be mocked using Jest to ensure deterministic test results.
 * - Integration: This module should be tested in conjunction with its immediate
 *   dependencies to verify data flow integrity.
 *
 * 5. ERROR HANDLING STRATEGY
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * - Graceful Degradation: If a non-critical subsystem fails, this module should
 *   catch the error and fallback to a safe default state rather than crashing.
 * - Logging: All unhandled exceptions must be logged to the central monitoring
 *   system (e.g., Sentry, Datadog) with full stack traces and context.
 * - User Feedback: Frontend components must provide clear, localized error
 *   messages to the user without exposing sensitive technical details.
 *
 * 6. STATE MANAGEMENT (FRONTEND SPECIFIC)
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * - If this is a React component, avoid prop drilling by leveraging Context API
 *   or global state stores (Zustand/Redux) for deeply nested state.
 * - Side effects (useEffect) must carefully manage their dependency arrays to
 *   prevent infinite render loops.
 *
 * 7. DATABASE INTERACTIONS (BACKEND SPECIFIC)
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * - Queries must be indexed and optimized. Avoid N+1 query problems by using
 *   Prisma's include/select capabilities effectively.
 * - Database transactions should be used for all multi-step write operations
 *   to ensure ACID compliance and data consistency.

const jwt = require('jsonwebtoken'); // WHAT: Imports the jsonwebtoken library. WHY: Needed to create and sign JSON Web Tokens for GitHub App authentication.
const axios = require('axios'); // WHAT: Imports the axios HTTP client. WHY: Used to make API requests to GitHub to obtain access tokens.

if (!process.env.GITHUB_APP_ID) {
    console.log('[github] GITHUB_APP_ID not set — GitHub App features disabled');
}

const getAppJwt = () => { // WHAT: Defines a function to generate a JWT for the GitHub App. WHY: GitHub requires a signed JWT to authenticate as an App before requesting an installation token.
    const appId = process.env.GITHUB_APP_ID; // WHAT: Retrieves the GitHub App ID from environment variables. WHY: Identifies which GitHub App is making the request.
    const rawKey = process.env.GITHUB_PRIVATE_KEY || process.env.GITHUB_APP_PRIVATE_KEY || ''; // WHAT: Retrieves the GitHub private key from environment variables. WHY: Needed to cryptographically sign the JWT.
    if (!appId || !rawKey) {
        return null;
    }
    const privateKey = rawKey.replace(/\\n/g, '\n'); // WHAT: Formats the private key by replacing escaped newlines. WHY: Environment variables often escape newlines, but the crypto module requires actual newline characters.

    const now = Math.floor(Date.now() / 1000); // WHAT: Gets the current time in seconds since epoch. WHY: JWT claims like 'iat' and 'exp' require time in seconds.
    const payload = { // WHAT: Creates the JWT payload object. WHY: Defines the claims (issued at, expiration, issuer) required by GitHub.
        iat: now - 60, // WHAT: Sets the 'issued at' time to 60 seconds in the past. WHY: Prevents token rejection due to clock drift between servers.
        exp: now + (5 * 60), // WHAT: Sets the 'expiration' time to 5 minutes in the future. WHY: Leaves buffer for clock drift so it doesn't exceed 10m max.
        iss: appId // WHAT: Sets the 'issuer' to the GitHub App ID. WHY: Tells GitHub which App is presenting the token.
    };

    return jwt.sign(payload, privateKey, { algorithm: 'RS256' }); // WHAT: Signs and returns the JWT using the RS256 algorithm. WHY: GitHub requires tokens to be signed with the App's private key using RSA.

    if (!jwtToken) {
        return null;

            `https://api.github.com/app/installations/${installationId}/access_tokens`, // WHAT: The URL for the installation token endpoint. WHY: Targets the specific installation ID provided.
            {}, // WHAT: Sends an empty body in the POST request. WHY: The endpoint doesn't require any body parameters by default.

                    'Authorization': `Bearer ${jwtToken}`, // WHAT: Sets the Bearer token to the generated JWT. WHY: Authenticates the request as the GitHub App.
                    'Accept': 'application/vnd.github.v3+json' // WHAT: Specifies the acceptable response format. WHY: Ensures GitHub returns the v3 REST API response.
                }
            }
        );
        return response.data.token; // WHAT: Returns the generated token from the response. WHY: Provides the caller with the token needed to make API calls as the installation.
    } catch (error) { // WHAT: Catches any errors from the axios request. WHY: Prevents the application from crashing and allows for error logging.
        console.error('Error fetching installation token:', error.response?.data || error.message); // WHAT: Logs the error details. WHY: Useful for debugging API failures, falling back to message if no response data exists.
        throw error; // WHAT: Rethrows the error. WHY: Allows the calling function to handle the failure appropriately.
    }
};

module.exports = { getInstallationAccessToken, getAppJwt }; // WHAT: Exports the token helper and the App JWT generator. WHY: The installation resolver needs to authenticate as the App itself to verify/rediscover installations.
